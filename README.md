# Chromium extensions for android.

Chromium does not support extensions on Android platform. Yandex says there are about 600 fixes required to make it work.
Some features are hard to support since browser's architecture for Android and desktop differs alot.

### Work plan.
1. Fix all build issues by disabling features.
2. Implement essential extensions features.
3. Clean the code so enable_extensions will not affect other builds.
4. Implement the rest of extesions features.
